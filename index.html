		    <h2>Multi-resolution blog template</h2>
			<p>In late 2006, A List Apart had an article about "<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/switchymclayout/">Adaptive Layout</a>", 
			which they described as a CSS-liquid layout that is optimized for multiple 
			screen resolutions, from a 240 pixel wide PDA to a 1920x1200 LCD.</p>

			<p>I was intrigued, so I decided to experiment with an adaptive blog template.</p>

			<img src="http://static.openpolitics.com/media/img/blog-layout-abridged-thumb.png" class="photo" alt="Blog Layout: Multiple Resolutions" />

			<p>The result isn't very "polished", but I finally got around to posting my own
			"adaptive blog layout", which uses javascript to tell the browser to use a different body css class, depending upon the reader's screen resolution.</p>

			<h3>Future Improvements</h3>

			<p>The template could be improved by paying better attention to the most common 
			browser resolutions and developing a grid-based version tailored to that 
			resolution.  I did the opposite -- I started with the content and defined CSS 
			rules to fit my text and images.</p>

		    <h2>Better metric: Gallons per 10K Miles</h2>
			<p>Last year the New York times had a short article proposing that instead of thinking
			about fuel economy in "miles per gallon", we should think about 
			"<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactivehttp://www.openpolitics.com/2008/12/14/magazine/2008_IDEAS.html#g-ideas">gallons 
			per mile</a>".</p>
	
			<p>The reasoning behind this poposals is that stating fuel economy in MPG 
				"leads consumers to significantly underestimate the gains in fuel efficiency 
				that can be achieved by trading in very low m.p.g. vehicles — even for 
				one that gets only a few more miles per gallon."</p>

			<blockquote>
				Larrick emphasizes that his long-term goal is to get everyone into the most fuel-efficient vehicles that exist. But right now, he says, “as a national-policy question, the urgency is getting people out of the 14-m.p.g. vehicles.” And m.p.g. ratings aren’t the most useful prod, largely because the real significance of differences in m.p.g. is often counterintuitive. The jump from 10 to 20 m.p.g., for example, saves more gas than the one from 20 to 40 m.p.g. The move from 10 to 11 m.p.g. can save nearly as much as the leap from 33 to 50 m.p.g.
			</blockquote>


			<a href="http://www.cadillac.com/cadillacjsp/model/gallery.jsp?model=hybrid&year=2009&primary=1&id=0" 
				title="2009 Cadillac Escalade" alt="2009 Cadillac Escalade">
				<img src="http://static.openpolitics.com/media/img/cadillac_escalade.png" width="400" class="photo" border="0" />
			</a>

			<p>People often scoff at the idea of hybrid trucks or SUVs like the Cadillac Escalade that only
				improve MGP from 14 to 20.  But if you do the math, over 10,000 miles, this decreases
				the number of gallons used from 714 gallons to 500 gallons.  This is a savings of 
				<strong>214 gallons</strong>,
				By comparison improving a Toyota Prius's mileage from 46MPG to 70MG only saves 
				<strong>75 gallons</strong> over 10,000 miles.</p>

			<p>Here is the comparison of "miles per gallon" (MPG) and "gallons per 10,000 miles" (GP10K):</p>

			<table class="data">
				<tr>
					<th>Vehicle</th>
					<th>MPG</th>
					<th>GP10K</th>
				</tr>
				<tr><td>Cadillac Escallade AWD</td><td>14</td><td>714</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Cadillac Escallade Hybrid</td><td>20</td><td>500</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Toyota Prius</td><td>46</td><td>217</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Hypothetical Hybrid</td><td>70</td><td>143</td></tr>
			</table>


			<p>To illustrate the point further, I put together a spreadsheet 
				using actual fuel economy figures for some current models, along with some extreme cases.</p>

If not, you’re re-working quite a bit of code. And the worst part is that code is almost all opaque to you and hidden in the pinax framework.</div>

That might be a sensible move, from the point of view of selling copies, especially on the newsstand. But it will also inevitably serve to erode the trust that many people, on Wall Street especially, have in the reporting of the WSJ.</p>

				<div class="description"><p>Commercial real estate loans are widely viewed to be an area of coming problems, in large part because such loans are normally made for periods of seven to 10 years, in anticipation that they will be rolled over into new loans at the end of the period. Many properties are no longer worth anything close to the amount owed, making such rollovers doubtful. </p>

<p>.. A bank owed, say, $4 million on a property now worth $3 million would previously have had to classify the entire loan as troubled. Now it can do that to the $1 million difference only.</p>

<p>Just how rapidly that becomes worse may depend on how many banks choose to “pretend and extend,” renewing the loan and hoping property values will recover.</p></div>

				<div class="description"><p>The case of Enron shows that network theory can map out a corrupt corporation just as well as an insurgency. When federal investigators released more than 500,000 e-mails between Enron employees, salivating researchers scoured the data for patterns that might have helped forecast the company's demise. Those e-mails—essentially a record of who was talking with whom—provide a far better accounting of how the company functioned than any organizational chart. Indeed, a pair of computer scientists at the Florida Institute of Technology discovered that rapid changes in the e-mail network's behavior did not coincide with external events like the resignation of the CEO. Rather, they seemed to anticipate these tectonics by roughly 30 days. Cliques—groups within the network in which every member has contact with every other member—grew eightfold in the month before the company went under.</p>

				<p>The Pecora Hearings demonized the bankers and resulted in 3-6-3 banking (Take deposits at 3%; lend them out at 6%; and be on the golf course by 3 p.m.).</p>

				<p>It took 40 years to begin getting out of that straight jacket. We were fortunate that for most of that time there were few international competitors to take advantage of our self-imposed, financial modesty.</p>

				<p>And yet, without Pecora’s bulldogging which resulted in Americans becoming angry at the Wall Street bankers citizens would have learned nothing about the bankers’ role in causing (contributing to?) the Depression.</p>

				<p>Anger fertilizes demagoguery. How do we balance the anger which will arise as a result of the hearings against the need for information?  <a href="http://baselinescenario.comhttp://www.openpolitics.com/2009/04/24/the-next-big-hearing-bill-moyers-tonight/" title="comment example: taken from Baseline Scenario"># Link</a></p>

				<p>Good to have bipartisan support. We must insure our regulators are as smart as those they regulate; I like the idea of a government-based rating bureau to value complex derivatives. We must insist that any large financial transaction trigger intensive oversight, and at the same time that a single large transaction is not concealed as many small ones. We must hold policymakers responsible. We must track the public interest and scrutinize any transaction where there is a risk of public harm. We must prevent prohibited transactions from jumping to offshore havens. We must overcome the cowboy culture of the trading room and insure that risk managers are rewarded as well as dealmakers. We must express a clear legislative intent to maintain stability in financial markets. We must tax dividends and interest less than capital gains. We must rely on a holding period in determining capital gains tax, and factor in inflation, only taxing real gains, while penalizing high gains over short periods of time. We must recognize that all large accumulations of capital require public scrutiny, even when not directly held by the public. We must limit what information is subject to protection as proprietary, and avoid the effect of misleading public statements regarding financial instruments. In short, we must shift the purpose of the financial community from gambling to stewardship.  <a href="http://baselinescenario.comhttp://www.openpolitics.com/2009/04/24/the-next-big-hearing-bill-moyers-tonight/"  title="comment example: taken from Baseline Scenario"># Link</a></p>
