ABOUT THIS PROJECT
--------------------
This is a template I created for my blog out, inspired by an artile in 
Alist Apart titled "Switchy McLayout: An Adaptive Layout Technique"

    http://www.alistapart.com/articles/switchymclayout/
    
My goal was to define a single html page that would result in a blog with 
different layouts, depending upon the browser resolution.  Browser resolution 
is captured by styleSheetResize.js, which then sets the body class to the 
approriate css class.
